# Instrumented opening browser qualification

This harness is **instrumented runtime evidence, not shipping-binary proof**.
`history_browser.py` and `qualify-history-realserver.mjs` remain unchanged and
qualify the separate older shipping app. No new HTTP control endpoint exists.

## Inputs and hosted invocation

Supply an independent, tracked-clean app checkout at
`d4c2772a95aa46da608b356c8fe7be074de1b7aa`, its already-built `ui/dist`, installed
app-owned Vite/Playwright dependencies and Chromium, and the independently built
ignored libtest artifact. This script never compiles, installs, starts production,
or uses the shipping executable. Use the existing hosted preparation; workflow
integration belongs to the parent owner.

The existing `opening-instrumented-receipt.json` must additionally include:

- `ui_files`: every relative `ui/dist` file and its SHA-256, excluding `.gitkeep`;
- `ui_lock_sha256`: SHA-256 of `ui/pnpm-lock.yaml`.

The receipt's `harness_source` must equal the executing harness HEAD; app SHA/tree,
executable hash, Cargo/UI locks, build rustc attestation, selector, successful
focused-test exit, evidence class and ignored-driver name are checked before any
runtime starts. Source/toolchain attribution is the independent builder's
attestation; hashes alone cannot prove source provenance. Artifact identities are
checked again after the run.

```sh
uv run tests/e2e/history_opening_browser.py \
  --app-root /absolute/pinned-app \
  --instrumented-exe /absolute/opening-instrumented-libtest \
  --instrumented-receipt /absolute/opening-instrumented-receipt.json \
  --output /absolute/new/opening-browser-evidence --timeout 1100
```

Ordinary and Global each get a separate exact ignored-test process and one arm,
with a short owner-only system-temp IPC root, fresh driver-owned HOME/database,
mock models and loopback listener. The compiled startup JSON must match the
artifact/source and owned paths; readiness is an actual HTTP GET. Fixtures reuse
the shipping harness's exact `Fixture.build`, HTTP/SSE helpers, hashing and owned
process-group cleanup by import, not copied implementations.

## What an executed pass asserts

- Existing equal-text manual continuation has a completed separate-message
  opening and remains independently rendered; text does not authorize suppression.
- Exact predecessor/key arm precedes a real asynchronous continue POST. Entered
  IPC certifies committed intent before first-message persistence, not mere POST
  acknowledgment.
- While held: aggregate latest/opening, direct row GET, independent new SSE Init,
  browser aggregate response, deferred reserved identity, read-only composer and
  absence of browser chat POST are observed.
- A harness-only owner-file switch makes the Vite preview destroy only this
  aggregate's GET transport. The browser witnesses actual request failure and a
  visible history error. No synthetic JSON, public headers, page routing or
  offline mode are used.
- One exact release precedes actual accepted message/event-cursor observation,
  enabled composer, exact successor chat request/response and persistence while
  roster refresh still fails. Historical source pin and physical anchor remain.
- Another owner-file token destroys only already-open exact successor SSE
  responses. The same page's new stream request and accepted Init are captured,
  with no navigation/offline substitute; transport receipts require a real drop.
  Accepted identity, composer, source pin and physical anchor survive reconnect.
  An explicit chapter click then renders exactly one persisted manual opening.

The pinned app has **no `/history-roster` route**: its actual roster refresh is
`GET /api/product-conversations/{id}` (or the exact Global history GET). The fault
path is taken from an actual browser aggregate response and constrained to the
owned aggregate, not a guessed nonexistent endpoint.

The pinned `ContinueConversationRequest` has **no `opening_authority` field**.
Normal manual POST selects `user_authorized_instruction`; generated context is
not selectable through this contract. Generated-authority browser acceptance is
explicitly **uncovered**, not fabricated or passed. Delayed response-race,
content-edit/replay-generation cases, shipping builds, real providers, production,
non-Chromium engines and physical devices are also not qualified by this harness.

## Compiler-free validation

```sh
python3 -B tests/e2e/history_opening_browser.test.py
node --test ui/scripts/qualify-history-opening-realserver.selftest.mjs
node --check ui/scripts/qualify-history-opening-realserver.mjs
```

These tests mock processes/proxy callbacks only inside selftests. They exercise
identity rejection, narrow transport targets, release-once failure cleanup and
owned stream tracking without starting any server/browser or invoking a compiler.
Syntax/selftest success is not runtime success. Runtime `result.json` starts
failed, includes per-case receipts, and records verified actual startup separately
from browser completion. Child failure logs and cleanup receipts remain retained.
