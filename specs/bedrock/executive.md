# Bedrock - Executive Summary

## Requirements Summary

Bedrock provides the core conversation state machine for PhoenixIDE. Users interact with an LLM agent through a reliable, predictable execution model. Messages flow through well-defined states: idle, awaiting LLM (with retry tracking), executing tools serially, and handling errors. Tools execute one at a time in LLM-requested order to respect intent and prevent conflicts. Cancellation generates synthetic tool results to maintain message chain integrity required by LLM APIs. Error handling distinguishes retryable errors (network, rate limit) from non-retryable (auth), with automatic retry and UI-visible state. Sub-agents complete by calling a dedicated result submission tool. Each conversation has a fixed working directory set at creation. User messages with images are passed through to the LLM provider. Messages sent while agent is busy are rejected (user can cancel if needed). Conversations have an Explore or Work mode (see `specs/projects/`) stored alongside state; mode determines tool availability and is separate from state machine state.

## Technical Summary

Implements Elm Architecture with a typed-effect executor boundary. The SM has two pure entry points: `handle_user_event()` for API-initiated events and `handle_outcome()` for executor results. Effects carry oneshot channels typed to their expected outcome (`LlmOutcome`, `ToolOutcome`, `SubAgentOutcome`, `PersistOutcome`) — the compiler prevents invalid event/state combinations. Persistence uses `CheckpointData::ToolRound` which structurally requires matched `tool_use`/`tool_result` pairs. Error classification is exhaustive with no `Unknown` variant. Executor loop uses `StepResult::Terminal` to force explicit exit on terminal states. Token streaming uses fire-and-forget `StreamToken` effects routed to SSE without SM state transitions. Sub-agents require mandatory `timeout: Duration` with deadline enforcement in executor `select!`. On server restart, conversations resume from idle with full message history preserved.
