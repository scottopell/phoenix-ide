# PhoenixIDE

> Rising from the ashes - A new beginning

PhoenixIDE is a complete rewrite born from the lessons learned from rustey-shelley. 
After a catastrophic data loss, we're starting fresh with a cleaner architecture 
and the wisdom gained from the previous implementation.

## Core Principles

1. **Immutable Working Directories** - Each conversation has a fixed working directory
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns** - Tools, execution, and state management are clearly separated
3. **Robust Error Handling** - Learn from past mistakes
4. **Git-First Development** - Regular commits, clear history

## Project Status

- [x] Initial project setup
- [ ] Core architecture design
- [ ] Tool system implementation
- [ ] LLM integration
- [ ] Web UI

## Background

This project rose from the ashes of rustey-shelley after a git repository corruption 
incident on 2026-01-28. We're taking this opportunity to build something better.
